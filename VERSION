Deployed: 2025-11-13 17:15:00

🔥 CRITICAL FIX v1.4 - STRATEGY MANAGER NOW FUNCTIONAL:
✅ MarketRegime enum names corrected (STRONG_BULLISH → STRONG_BULLISH_TREND)
✅ AttributeError ELIMINATED - StrategyManager will initialize successfully
✅ Multi-Strategy System NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL
✅ Strategy logs WILL APPEAR in Railway for first time

🐛 ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED:
The strategy_manager.py was referencing incorrect enum names:

This was causing AttributeError on line 546 preventing StrategyManager initialization.
