      "Bash(and exit before -10 USD loss?\"\n\nSolution: Added ML-based exit signal system that:\n\n1. Checks positions every 60 seconds when in ANY loss\n2. Checks every 30 seconds when approaching stop-loss (within 3%)\n3. Uses ML model to predict if market is turning against position\n4. Exits if:\n   - LONG position + ML predicts SELL (>55% conf)\n   - SHORT position + ML predicts BUY (>55% conf)\n\nExample: AAVE SHORT entry $218.90, instead of waiting for stop at $221.25 (-$10),\nML could detect bearish momentum ending at $220 and exit at only -$4.\n\nBenefits:\n- Reduces average loss per trade\n- ML learns from both entries AND exits\n- More adaptive to changing market conditions\n\nFiles modified:\n- src/position_monitor.py: Added _should_request_ml_exit_signal() and ML exit logic\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
