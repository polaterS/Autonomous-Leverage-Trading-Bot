# Force redeploy v5.0.4 - 2-of-3 Confirmation Fix - 5 Dec 2025 Thu
# 🛡️ CRITICAL FIX: Bot was NOT opening any trades!
#
# 🎯 v5.0.4 FEATURES:
#   ✅ 2-of-3 confirmation rule (was: ALL 3 required)
#   ✅ RSI relaxed: 35/65 (was: 30/70 too strict)
#   ✅ Candlestick + Volume = ENTRY OK
#   ✅ Candlestick + RSI = ENTRY OK
#   ✅ Volume + RSI = ENTRY OK
#
# 🛡️ WHY BOT WAS NOT TRADING:
#   ❌ OLD: Required ALL 3 confirmations simultaneously
#      • RSI ≤30 OR ≥70: ~5% probability
#      • Volume ≥1.5x: ~25% probability
#      • Candlestick pattern: ~15% probability
#      • ALL 3 TOGETHER: 0.05 × 0.25 × 0.15 = 0.19% !!!
#      • Result: Nearly ZERO trades for hours!
#
#   ✅ NEW: 2-of-3 confirmations sufficient
#      • Any 2 confirmations = ~10-15% probability
#      • Bot will now actually trade!
#      • Still professional quality (2 confirmations minimum)
#
# 📊 Previous versions:
#   - v5.0.3: Closed Candle + Stop Hunt Detection
#   - v5.0.2: Partial TP + Breakeven System
#   - v5.0.1: /analyze BTC Command
#   - v5.0.0: Level-Based Trading System (complete redesign)
