# Force redeploy v5.0.7 - Level Side Check Fix - 5 Dec 2025 Thu
# 🛡️ CRITICAL FIX: Check correct side of S/R level before entry!
#
# 🎯 v5.0.7 FEATURES:
#   ✅ Level side validation added
#   ✅ Resistance: Price must be AT or BELOW (not above)
#   ✅ Support: Price must be AT or ABOVE (not below)
#   ✅ Fixed confirmation display (correct ✓/✗ marks)
#
# 🐛 BUG FIXED:
#   ❌ BCH SHORT at $578.68 when resistance was $576.61
#      • Price was ABOVE resistance = resistance BROKEN
#      • Should NOT short at a broken resistance!
#
#   ✅ NEW LOGIC:
#      • For Resistance: current_price <= resistance * 1.001
#      • For Support: current_price >= support * 0.999
#      • If price is on wrong side → level is BROKEN → skip!
#
# 🔧 Also Fixed:
#   ❌ OLD: "Conf: Candle ✓ Vol 1.8x ✓ RSI 36 ✓" (all show ✓)
#   ✅ NEW: "Conf: Candle ✓ Vol 1.8x ✓ RSI 36 ✗" (correct marks)
