# Force redeploy v4.7.12 - DERIVATIVES FILTER REMOVED - 4 Dec 2025 Wed
# ❌ REMOVED: Derivatives = 50% filter was blocking ALL trades
#
# 🔧 v4.7.12 CHANGE:
#   ❌ REMOVED: Derivatives = 50% filter
#      - Problem: Filter was blocking 90%+ of all trades
#      - Cause: Bybit API doesn't provide Funding/OI/L-S data via OHLCV
#      - These require separate API endpoints (future enhancement)
#      - For now, removed this filter to allow trading
#
# 🛡️ ACTIVE FILTERS (4 protection layers):
#   ✅ FILTER 1: Technical Advanced < 40% → Skip trade
#   ✅ FILTER 2: ATR < 0.3% → Skip trade (low volatility)
#   ✅ FILTER 3: ADX > 40 → Skip trade (trend exhaustion)
#   ✅ FILTER 4: Market 80%+ Neutral → Raise min_score to 70
#
# 📊 Previous versions:
#   - v4.7.11: Filter reason display fix
#   - v4.7.10: Quality protection filters
# Instant trading still DISABLED - main loop handles all entries
