# Force redeploy v5.0.3 - Closed Candle + Stop Hunt - 5 Dec 2025 Thu
# 🛡️ CRITICAL FIX: Professional Entry Timing
#
# 🎯 v5.0.3 FEATURES:
#   ✅ Pattern detection on CLOSED candle (not forming)
#   ✅ Stop Hunt Reversal pattern detection
#   ✅ False breakout protection
#   ✅ Professional candle close waiting
#   ✅ Uses iloc[-2] for last CLOSED candle
#   ✅ Prevents false signals from forming candles
#
# 🛡️ WHY THIS MATTERS:
#   ❌ BEFORE: Used forming candle (iloc[-1])
#      • Hammer pattern appears → candle changes → false signal!
#      • Bot enters during stop hunt → gets stopped out
#
#   ✅ AFTER: Uses CLOSED candle (iloc[-2])
#      • Pattern is FINAL and reliable
#      • Stop hunt reversal is DETECTED as bullish signal
#      • Professional traders wait for candle close
#
# 🎯 STOP HUNT DETECTION:
#   - Detects when price wicks below support but closes above
#   - This is actually BULLISH (stop hunt = buying opportunity)
#   - New pattern: STOP_HUNT_REVERSAL with bonus score
#
# 📊 Previous versions:
#   - v5.0.2: Partial TP + Breakeven System
#   - v5.0.1: /analyze BTC Command
#   - v5.0.0: Level-Based Trading System (complete redesign)
