# Force redeploy v5.0.5 - RSI Direction Filter - 5 Dec 2025 Thu
# 🛡️ CRITICAL FIX: Prevent counter-trend entries!
#
# 🎯 v5.0.5 FEATURES:
#   ✅ RSI Direction Filter added
#   ✅ RSI < 30 (oversold) → Block SHORT
#   ✅ RSI > 70 (overbought) → Block LONG
#   ✅ Prevents APT-like losses (SHORT at RSI 19)
#
# 🛡️ WHAT HAPPENED:
#   ❌ APT/USDT SHORT at RSI 19
#      • RSI 19 = OVERSOLD = Price likely to bounce UP
#      • Entering SHORT = Going AGAINST momentum
#      • Result: Loss
#
#   ✅ v5.0.5: RSI Direction Filter
#      • RSI < 30 → Block SHORT (don't short oversold)
#      • RSI > 70 → Block LONG (don't long overbought)
#      • Trade WITH momentum, not AGAINST it
#
# 📊 Logic:
#   | RSI Zone    | LONG   | SHORT  |
#   |-------------|--------|--------|
#   | <30 oversold| ✅ OK  | ❌ BLOCK|
#   | 30-70 normal| ✅ OK  | ✅ OK  |
#   | >70 overbought| ❌ BLOCK| ✅ OK |
