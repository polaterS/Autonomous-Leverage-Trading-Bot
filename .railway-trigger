# Force redeploy v4.7.13 - ADX FILTER SOURCE FIX - 4 Dec 2025 Wed
# 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: ADX filter was using wrong data source
#
# 🔧 v4.7.13 FIX:
#   ❌ BUG: ADX filter checked indicators_15m.get('adx', 25)
#      - indicators_15m often had missing/wrong ADX value
#      - Defaulted to 25, so ADX > 40 filter never triggered
#      - JASMY with ADX 41.7 was NOT filtered (should have been!)
#
#   ✅ FIX: Now uses analysis['trend']['adx'] from Price Action
#      - Same ADX value shown in trade message
#      - JASMY ADX 41.7 > 40 → Will now be FILTERED
#      - Prevents entering exhausted trends
#
# 🛡️ ACTIVE FILTERS (4 protection layers):
#   ✅ FILTER 1: Technical Advanced < 40% → Skip trade
#   ✅ FILTER 2: ATR < 0.3% → Skip trade (low volatility)
#   ✅ FILTER 3: ADX > 40 (from Price Action) → Skip trade
#   ✅ FILTER 4: Market 80%+ Neutral → Raise min_score to 70
#
# 📊 Previous versions:
#   - v4.7.12: Derivatives filter removed
#   - v4.7.11: Filter reason display fix
# Instant trading still DISABLED - main loop handles all entries
