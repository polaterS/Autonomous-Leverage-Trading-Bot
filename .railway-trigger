# Force redeploy v5.0.8 - Level Proximity Re-Validation - 5 Dec 2025 Thu
# 🛡️ CRITICAL FIX: Re-check S/R level proximity BEFORE execution!
#
# 🎯 v5.0.8 FEATURES:
#   ✅ Level proximity re-validation at execution time
#   ✅ Prevents trade when price drifts away from S/R level
#   ✅ 0.5% threshold enforced at BOTH scan AND execution
#   ✅ Telegram notification when trade skipped due to drift
#
# 🐛 BUG FIXED:
#   ❌ BCH SHORT at $578.17 when resistance was $582.52
#      • Scan found signal at $580 (0.4% from resistance) → VALID
#      • By execution, price drifted to $578.17 (0.75%) → INVALID
#      • OLD: Only checked if price moved >1% from scan → PASSED
#      • NEW: Also check if still within 0.5% of S/R level!
#
#   ✅ NEW LOGIC:
#      • Fresh price validation (1% threshold) - existing
#      • Level proximity re-validation (0.5% threshold) - NEW!
#      • If price drifted from level → SKIP trade
