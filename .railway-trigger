# Force redeploy v4.7.10 - QUALITY PROTECTION FILTERS - 4 Dec 2025 Wed
# 🛡️ NEW: 5 Quality Protection Filters to prevent bad trades
#
# 🛡️ v4.7.10 FILTER DETAILS:
#   ✅ FILTER 1: Technical Advanced < 40% → Skip trade
#      - CVD, Ichimoku, Liquidations giving warning signals
#      - When these are weak, trade direction is unreliable
#
#   ✅ FILTER 2: Derivatives = 50% (fallback) → Skip trade
#      - No real Funding Rate, Open Interest, Long/Short Ratio data
#      - 50% exactly = fallback value, not real calculation
#
#   ✅ FILTER 3: ATR < 0.5% → Skip trade
#      - Very low volatility environment
#      - Price won't move enough to hit profit targets
#
#   ✅ FILTER 4: ADX > 40 → Skip trade
#      - Trend is exhausted
#      - High probability of reversal
#
#   ✅ FILTER 5: Market 80%+ Neutral → Raise min_score to 70
#      - When market is indecisive, require stronger setups
#      - Normal min_score is 30, raised to 70 in neutral market
#
# 🎯 EXPECTED RESULT:
#   - Fewer but higher quality trades
#   - Trades will have proper market conditions
#   - Better profit probability due to filtering
