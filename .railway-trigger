# Force redeploy v5.0.10 - Async Portfolio Updates - 5 Dec 2025 Thu
# 🔄 Portfolio updates now run in background task!
#
# 🎯 v5.0.10 FEATURES:
#   ✅ Portfolio updates run asynchronously (background task)
#   ✅ 20s interval, independent from main loop
#   ✅ Updates sent even during market scans
#   ✅ No more blocking when scan_and_execute() runs
#
# 🐛 BUG FIXED:
#   ❌ OLD: Portfolio update waited for market scan to finish
#      • Market scan takes 60-120 seconds
#      • Portfolio update was blocked during this time
#      • User didn't receive updates during scans
#
#   ✅ NEW LOGIC:
#      • _portfolio_update_loop() runs as asyncio.create_task()
#      • Independent from main trading loop
#      • Sends updates every 20s regardless of scan status
