# Force redeploy v4.7.11 - FILTER DISPLAY FIX - 4 Dec 2025 Wed
# 🔧 FIX: Filter reason was NOT displayed in Telegram messages
#
# 🔧 v4.7.11 FIXES:
#   ✅ FIX 1: Filter reason now shown in Telegram
#      - Problem: "Reason: = STRONG SETUP" instead of actual filter reason
#      - Solution: Check for filter_reason when Quality is FILTERED
#      - Now shows: "🛡️ FILTER: ATR too low: 0.25% (need 0.3%+)"
#
#   ✅ FIX 2: ATR threshold lowered from 0.5% to 0.3%
#      - Problem: 0.5% was too strict - ALL trades filtered in neutral market
#      - Solution: Lower to 0.3% to allow more trades
#
# 🛡️ ACTIVE FILTERS (5 protection layers):
#   ✅ FILTER 1: Technical Advanced < 40% → Skip trade
#   ✅ FILTER 2: Derivatives = 50% (fallback) → Skip trade
#   ✅ FILTER 3: ATR < 0.3% → Skip trade (lowered from 0.5%)
#   ✅ FILTER 4: ADX > 40 → Skip trade
#   ✅ FILTER 5: Market 80%+ Neutral → Raise min_score to 70
