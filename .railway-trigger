# Force redeploy v5.0.9 - Trendline Price Position Validation - 5 Dec 2025 Thu
# 🛡️ CRITICAL FIX: Validate price position relative to trendline!
#
# 🎯 v5.0.9 FEATURES:
#   ✅ Trendline price position validation added
#   ✅ Ascending line: Price must be AT or ABOVE (not below)
#   ✅ Descending line: Price must be AT or BELOW (not above)
#   ✅ Broken trendlines are now skipped
#
# 🐛 BUG FIXED:
#   ❌ BLUR LONG at $0.0353 when ascending trendline was $0.0355
#      • Price was BELOW the ascending line = support BROKEN!
#      • Trade logic said "ascending = support = LONG" ALWAYS
#      • But /analyze correctly showed it as "resistance" (above price)
#
#   ✅ NEW LOGIC:
#      • Ascending trendline: current_price >= line_price * 0.999
#      • Descending trendline: current_price <= line_price * 1.001
#      • If price on wrong side → trendline BROKEN → skip!
#
# 🔧 ROOT CAUSE:
#   Trade logic classified trendlines by DIRECTION only
#   /analyze re-classified by PRICE POSITION
#   Now both use consistent price position validation!
