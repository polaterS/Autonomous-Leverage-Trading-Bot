# Force redeploy v4.6.1 - Balanced Confluence Scoring - 2 Dec 2025 Mon
# FIXES:
#   ✅ MIN_CONFLUENCE_SCORE: 75 → 60 (default threshold lowered)
#   ✅ Institutional fallback: 40% → 60% (15/25 pts instead of 10/25)
#   ✅ Better error handling in institutional indicators scoring
# Now trades with 60+ score will be executed (previously required 75+)
# Instant trading still DISABLED - main loop handles all entries
